# x Multi-Class Planned Design Recipe


## 1. Describe the Problem

_Put or write the user story here. Add any clarifying notes you might have._

> As a customer 
> So that I can check if I want to order something 
> I would like to see a list of dishes with prices. 

> As a customer
> So that I can order the meal I want
> I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes.

> As a customer
> So that I can verify that my order is correct
> I would like to see an itemised receipt with a grand total.

> As a customer
> So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
> I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered.
 
 
## 2. Design the Class System

_Consider diagramming out the classes and their relationships. Take care to focus on the details you see as important, not everything. The diagram below uses asciiflow.com but you could also use excalidraw.com, draw.io, or miro.com_
'''
'''

_Also design the interface of each class in more detail._
'''python
# EXAMPLE 

'''

## 3. Create Examples as Integration Tests

_Create examples of the classes being used together in different situations and combinations that reflect the ways in which the system will be used._
'''python
# EXAMPLE 

'''

_Create examples, where appropriate, of the behaviour of each relevant class at a more granular level of detail._
'''python
# EXAMPLE 

'''


_Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go._



## 4. Implement the Behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour._
