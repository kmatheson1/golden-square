# Improve Grammar Method Design Recipe


## 1. Describe the Problem

_Put or write the user story here. Add any clarifying notes you might have._

> As a user
> So that I can improve my grammar
> I want to verify that a text starts with a capital letter and ends with a suitable sentence-ending punctuation mark.

## 2. Design the Method Signature

_Include the name of the function, its parameters, return value, and side effects._

'''python
# EXAMPLE 

'''

## 3. Create Examples as Tests

_Make a list of examples of what the function will take and return._

'''python
# EXAMPLE 

'''

## 4. Implement the Behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour._
